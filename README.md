# namegenscript
A name generator I am posting to have somone tell me why it takes so long to run.

How it works:

Save Script.bat somewhere. Make a folder in that place called "data". Put the files from "data.zip" into the folder. Put RoadsToName.txt into the data folder too. Run the sccript.

Once it finishes, it will reach a "press any key to continue" screen. Any generation errors will be listed on the screen. The outputed file will be GennedriverNames.csv. It will be foudn in the data folder.
